The Makefile will compile both gameoflife and gameoflifethreads and both can be run. The default one I've changed to pulsar.txt and I changed all 
the txt files inside of the boards files to pgm format. Once run, the program will put all images inside the Images folder.

I had premade some images from what the program would run like by doing gosper_glider_gun.
The zip also contains the two photos proving the Openmptimes and the thread times.

Thank you very much for the course teacher!

Way to run:
./game_of_life 100 Boards/gosper_glider_gun.txt
